# week-1
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to optimize and manage water resources efficiently.Water quality prediction involves using data-driven or computational models to forecast the physical, chemical, and biological parameters that determine the safety and usability of water resources. The main goal is to assess water conditions for drinking, agriculture, industry, and ecological balance.
#WEEK2
## Week 2

Added project (EDA,Exploratory Data Analysis Data Transformation Feature Selection Model Training Accuracy Evaluation)as a continuation of Week 1 after clearing outputs and optimizing the code.
